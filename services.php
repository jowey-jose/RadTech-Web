	<H1>Services Offered</H1>
	<p>To maintain culture of safety in ionizing radiation emitting facilities, RadTech has evolved and specialized in the following broad sectors of Radiation Monitoring and surveillance campaign:</p>
	<ul>
		<B>
		<li>Safety assessment of premise and Quality Assurance of devices:</li>
	    </B>
		<p>The service entails carrying out realtime radiation survey measurement of ionizing radiation emitting installations and adjacent environments to ensure people within those environs as well as personnel working in such installations are working in safe environment. In addition, such facilities installed devices are tested for quality assurance and Radiation safety and leakage test to ensure that they work within stipulated limits and hence ensure they donâ€™t contribute to radiation exposure. As a requirement from the regulator, leak test analysis and radiation survey should be carried out on annual basis. Our Internal safety and Quality assurance team are professionally trained in the field of medical physics and Nuclear Science to ensure they offer quality support service to such facilities. </p>
        <B>
		<li>
			Dosimetry services (Personnel radiation monitoring to occupationally exposed personnel): </li>
		</B>
		<p>At RadTech, we have partnered with Landauer inc (France) in offering the latest OSLD Dosimetry services (Optically Stimulated Light Dosimetry) to ensure safety on the occupationally exposed personnel. Our Dosimetry monitoring campaign is supported by three key pillars; advanced OSLD technology, sound metrology of dose measurement and efficient logistical support. This has allowed Radtech to be the Dosimetry services provider of choice in the country.The service entails carrying out environmental survey for manmade spills and imported food and bulk commodities at the port of entry to ensure population is safeguarded. Primarily, our service is pegged after the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in Ukraine which prompted IAEA member state to carry out Radiation contamination assessment of imported products with a view of safeguarding their population from internal radiation exposure. At RadTech, we have acquired state of the art PM1406 (Digital support) for easy identification of radionuclides Cs-134, Cs-137 and K-40 radionuclides that are likely to induce contamination</p>
		<B>
		<li>Design and Radioprotection Radiation Administering premise </li> 
		</B>   
			<p>Proper design of facilities that administer ionizing radiation is key in ensuring such facility will not pose danger to the end user during its useful lifetime. At RadTech we offer consultancy in design of such facilities while considering the ALARA principle for optimized radioprotection goals. We adhere to stipulated standards by RPBK and NCRP guidelines in design and advising clients during construction planning stages.</p>
		<B>
		<li>Supply of Radiation Protection materials</li> 
	    </B>
		<p>ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle underscores the importance of radiation shielding in minimizing exposure to ionizing radiation. At RadTech, we ensure that the facility guidelines are given,we also supply and fabricate radioprotection materials. This is to ensure personnel working in these facilities are adequately radio-protected. Materials provided include Lead sheet of different thickness and sizes, Neutron shielding materials, Lead glass of different sizes, fabricated protective mobile screens, Lead gloves boards among others.</p>
		<B>
		<li>Compliance and Licensing facilitation</li>
	    </B>
		<p>The Radiation Protection Board is the only statutory body recognized by the Kenya Government for Regulation of the Ionizing Radiation sector in the country. The body therefore among other functions is mandated to issue licenses to organizations that harness ionizing radiation. Radtech, being one of the accredited service provider carries out assessment of facilities and issues report to RPBK for the purposes of licensing. We facilitate in follow-up of Licenses and ensure that our clients are in full compliance with the law through playing the liaison role. </p>
		<B>
		<li>Training</li> 
	    </B>
		<p>At RadTech, we offer training on Radiation safety and awareness. Our training has been tailor made to fit our audience as well type of radiation processes applied in such industries. Our Personnel are professional experts in the field of ionizing radiation and are equipped in dealing with any challenge hence ensuring your personnel are aware of radiation and how to apply safeguard measures</p>
