              <h2 class="title text-cursive mb-4">1) Safety assessment of premise and Quality Assurance of devices:</h2>
              <p>The service entails carrying out realtime radiation survey measurement of ionizing radiation emitting installations and adjacent environments to ensure people within those environs as well as personnel working in such installations are working in safe environment. In addition, such facilities installed devices are tested for quality assurance and Radiation safety and leakage test to ensure that they work within stipulated limits and hence ensure they donâ€™t contribute to radiation exposure. As a requirement from the regulator, leak test analysis and radiation survey should be carried out on annual basis. Our Internal safety and Quality assurance team are professionally trained in the field of medical physics and Nuclear Science to ensure they offer quality support service to such facilities.</p>

              <h2 class="title text-cursive mb-4">2) Dosimetry services (Personnel radiation monitoring to occupationally exposed personnel):</h2>
              <p>At RadTech, we have partnered with Landauer inc (France) in offering the latest OSLD Dosimetry services (Optically Stimulated Light Dosimetry) to ensure safety on the occupationally exposed personnel. Our Dosimetry monitoring campaign is supported by three key pillars; advanced OSLD technology, sound metrology of dose measurement and efficient logistical support. This has allowed Radtech to be the Dosimetry services provider of choice in the country.The service entails carrying out environmental survey for manmade spills and imported food and bulk commodities at the port of entry to ensure population is safeguarded. Primarily, our service is pegged after the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in Ukraine which prompted IAEA member state to carry out Radiation contamination assessment of imported products with a view of safeguarding their population from internal radiation exposure. At RadTech, we have acquired state of the art PM1406 (Digital support) for easy identification of radionuclides Cs-134, Cs-137 and K-40 radionuclides that are likely to induce contamination.</p>

              <p>ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle underscores the importance of radiation shielding in minimizing exposure to ionizing radiation. At RadTech, we ensure that the facility guidelines are given,we also supply and fabricate radioprotection materials. This is to ensure personnel working in these facilities are adequately radio-protected. Materials provided include Lead sheet of different thickness and sizes, Neutron shielding materials, Lead glass of different sizes, fabricated protective mobile screens, Lead gloves boards among others.</p>
